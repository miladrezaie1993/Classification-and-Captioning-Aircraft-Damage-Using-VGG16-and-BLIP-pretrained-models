## **Introduction**

A pre-trained VGG16 model is used to classify aircraft damage and generate captions using a Transformer-based pretrained model.

## **Project Overview**

Aircraft damage detection is essential for maintaining the safety and longevity of aircraft. Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to automate the classification of aircraft damage into two categories: "dent" and "crack." For this, we will utilize feature extraction with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify the damage from aircraft images. Additionally, we will use a pre-trained Transformer model to generate captions and summaries for the images.

## **Aim of the Project**

The goal of this project is to develop an automated model that accurately classifies aircraft damage from images. We will have a trained and evaluated model that utilizes feature extraction from VGG16 for damage classification. This model will be applicable in real-world damage detection within the aviation industry. Furthermore, the project will showcase how we can use a Transformer-based model to caption and summarize images, providing a detailed description of the damage.

## **Final Output**

- A trained model capable of classifying aircraft images into "dent" and "crack" categories, enabling automated aircraft damage detection.
- A Transformer-based model that generates captions and summaries of images
